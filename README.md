# Professional Portfolio

This repo is for module two's challenge assignment.

## Description

The challenge is an Job-seeking coding assessment or take-home assignment (no starter code is provided, we will build this web application by scratch). The goal is to create a portfolio from scratch that will showcase my work. It will showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. The portfolio will highlight my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. It will include several deployed projects that will be used for me to apply and receive an initial interview at companies. I will be applying the skills I've learned in HTML and CSS. In particular, it will showcase the advanced CSS skills we have learned such as flexbox, media queries and CSS variables. for a marketing agency that has hired me to make it more accessible.

The motivation behind this project is to create a web application from scratch as well as create a portfolio that we will maintain to help us after bootcamp graduation. I built this portfolio in order to hone my own skills in HTML, CSS (Advanced CSS as well) and Git to ensure that I begin to understand more about the developer mindset and process. The problem it solved is making the a portfolio from scratch will utilize what we have learned thus far in the bootcamp. After completing this project, I have been able build an application from scratch and understand the process.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
